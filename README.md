# TransformerFaceRecognition
Implementation of the paper "Neighborhood Deformable Attention Transformer for Face Recognition with Reconstruction Network". This face recognition module incorporated transformer-based encoder network to extract relevant features and use reconstruction network to guild the encoder to learn representative features of the actual face.
